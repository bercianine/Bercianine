### 💼 My experience
From healthcare to streaming, I have a track record of designing applications that meet users' needs and exceed business expectations. With a deep understanding of end-to-end design process and human-centered design, I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on. I thrive on challenges and love to tackle complex problems with creativity and empathy.

### 👩‍💻 Currently learning
Coding! Super excited to dive deep into this universe as a student at Le Wagon's Web Development Bootcamp.
