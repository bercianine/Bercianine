### 💼 My experience
I have 5+ years of experience and a passion for creating innovative, data-driven products. From healthcare to streaming, I have a proven track record of designing applications that meet users' needs and exceed business expectations. With a deep understanding of end-to-end design process and human-centered design, I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on. I thrive on challenges and love to tackle complex problems with creativity and empathy.

### 💡 Outside of work
You can find me roller skating, doing yoga, hosting dinner parties and enjoying music (send me some recommendations!).
