👋 Hi there! I'm Sofia, a Product Designer with 5+ years of experience and a passion for creating innovative, data-driven products. From healthcare to streaming, I have a proven track record of designing applications that meet users' needs and exceed business expectations.

📝 With a deep understanding of end-to-end design process and human-centered design, I bring a unique perspective to every project I work on. I thrive on challenges and love to tackle complex problems with creativity and empathy.

💡 Outside of work you can find me roller skating, doing yoga, hosting dinner parties and enjoying music (send me some recommendations!).

✨ Let's connect and chat about how I can help bring your product vision to life!
