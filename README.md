## 💼 My experience
With a solid foundation in Ruby on Rails and other programming languages, I have successfully led the development of a web app called MOVIN, showcasing my ability to navigate complex challenges within a fast-paced, collaborative environment. In my previous role as a Senior UX/UI Designer, I built high skills in cross-functional collaboration, taking ownership of projects and generating actionable insights. I worked closely with developers, ensuring seamless communication from early stages up to implementation and validation.
